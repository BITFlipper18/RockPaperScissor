Hi peeps,

I have here a small (not simple as previously stated) Rock Paper Scissor game vs the computer.

This creation is purely based on the stuff I've learned and figured out by testing. I find great value trying to sketch a project purely on own imagination, before Google'ing out solutions.

There are definately more simple structures to use to make this work! (but it works :P)

Thank you for the visit!
